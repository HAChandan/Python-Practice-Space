    "'''\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "in this example, we define a class MyClass that has a static variable static_var initialized to 0. \n",
    "We also define an instance variable instance_var that is unique to each instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create an instance of the class (obj1), we increment the value of the static variable by 1 \n",
    "and assign it to the instance variable. When we create another instance of the class (obj2), we i\n",
    "ncrement the static variable again and assign the new value to the instance variable for that instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we print out the value of the static variable using the class itself, rather than an instance \n",
    "of the class. As you can see, the value of the static variable is shared among all instances of the class, \n",
    "and it is incremented each time a new instance is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Static variables can be useful for maintaining state across all instances of a class, or for sharing \n",
    "data among all instances of a class. However, it’s important to use them carefully and to ensure that \n",
    "their values are synchronized with the state of the program, especially in a multithreaded environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "Memory efficiency: Since static variables are shared among all instances of a class, they can save memory \n",
    "by avoiding the need to create multiple copies of the same data.\n",
    "Shared state: Static variables can provide a way to maintain shared state across all instances of a class, \n",
    "allowing all instances to access and modify the same data.\n",
    "Easy to access: Static variables can be accessed using the class name itself, without needing an instance \n",
    "of the class. This can make it more convenient to access and modify the data stored in a static variable.\n",
    "Initialization: Static variables can be initialized when the class is defined, making it easy to ensure that \n",
    "the variable has a valid starting value.\n",
    "Readability: Static variables can improve the readability of the code, as they clearly indicate that the \n",
    "data stored in the variable is shared among all instances of the class.\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "Inflexibility: Static variables can be inflexible, as their values are shared across all instances of the \n",
    "class, making it difficult to have different values for different instances.\n",
    "Hidden dependencies: Static variables can create hidden dependencies between different parts of the code, \n",
    "making it difficult to understand and modify the code.\n",
    "Thread safety: Static variables can be problematic in a multithreaded environment, as they can introduce \n",
    "race conditions and synchronization issues if not properly synchronized.\n",
    "Namespace pollution: Static variables can add to the namespace of the class, potentially causing name \n",
    "conflicts and making it harder to maintain the code.\n",
    "Testing: Static variables can make it more difficult to write effective unit tests, as the state of the \n",
    "static variable may affect the behavior of the class and its methods.\n",
    "Overall, static variables can be a useful tool in Python programming, but they should be used with care \n",
    "and attention to potential downsides, such as inflexibility, hidden dependencies, and thread safety concerns.\n",
